=== Creating a Weapon to track

To create a new Weapon, you need to call the `main.py` with the `-c|--create` argument and follow the instructions.

The `Weapon Name` is the name in the market e.g.: `AWP | The Prince (Field-Tested)` or `M4A4 | Asiimov (Field-Tested)`.

The `Variant ID` is a bit more complicated.
You need to go to https://skinbaron.de and lookup the requested weapon by typing its name and clicking on it.
After this you can see the `variantId` in the url (like this for the AWP Asiimov `https://skinbaron.de/?appId=730&variantId=38906&sort=BP` => `38906`).

The other values are related to skin baron as well and are used to only select a certain type of weared weapons.

You can check the creation of the items by calling the `main.py` with `-l|--list`.

TIP: You can chain the create and list argument for verification simply by calling `python3 main.py -cl`.

=== Processing the data

To resolve the prices for your weapons simply call the `main.py` with `-p|--process`.

=== Generating the charts and send the mail

To generate the charts simply call the `main.py` with `-d|--generate-charts`.
